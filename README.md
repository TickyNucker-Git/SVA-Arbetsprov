# SVA-Work sample
This is my first try at AngularJS!

Data (users and todos) is collected from a web API (http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and later displayed in the browser.
On the left side of the browser window you choose a user in the select menu. That users todos are then displayed in a table on the browsers right hand side.
